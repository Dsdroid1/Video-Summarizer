# Video Summarizer
A program that captures and condenses the key moments from a video and summarises it by creating a video which encompassing all the highlights. This is achieved by analysing audio and video to identify key moments which are then marked and cropped and pasted into a single video.

## Installation
-- TODO: Create and add instructions for installation


## Usage
-- TODO: Create and add instructions for program usage.

## Roadmap
- [x] Create a basic README.md document
- [ ] Step 2 of project:Read about topics assigned to you(Whatever network architecture a subteam will use,study about its basics)[Time: 29/01 to 07/02]
- [ ] Step 3 of project:Use the understanding of basics to think about how the network can fit in to a Video Summarizers
    - [ ] Step 3.1 of project--Try Basic implementations in a ml framework
    - [ ] Step 3.2 of project--Compare results of various teams over a basic model
- [ ] Step 4 of project--Whatever model performs best,continue the project with that as the new base,Introduce new optimisations and be try newer architectures,if time
